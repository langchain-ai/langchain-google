# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain Google




# Welcome Contributors

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to LangChain-Google.
As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether they involve new features, improved infrastructure, better documentation, or bug fixes.


# Contribute Code

To contribute to this project, please follow the ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow.
Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are a maintainer.

Please follow the checked-in pull request template when opening pull requests. Note related issues and tag relevant
maintainers.

Pull requests cannot land without passing the formatting, linting, and testing checks first. See [Testing](#testing) and
[Formatting and Linting](#formatting-and-linting) for how to run these checks locally.

It's essential that we maintain great documentation and testing. If you:
- Fix a bug
  - Add a relevant unit or integration test when possible. These live in `tests/unit_tests` and `tests/integration_tests`.
- Make an improvement
  - Update unit and integration tests when relevant.
- Add a feature
  - Add unit and integration tests.

We are a small, progress-oriented team. If there's something you'd like to add or change, opening a pull request is the
best way to get our attention.

## Dependency Management: Poetry and other env/dependency managers

This project utilizes [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) v1.7.1+ as a dependency manager.

‚ùóNote: *Before installing Poetry*, if you use `Conda`, create and activate a new Conda env (e.g. `conda create -n langchain python=3.9`)

Install Poetry: **[documentation on how to install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)**.

‚ùóNote: If you use `Conda` or `Pyenv` as your environment/package manager, after installing Poetry,
tell Poetry to use the virtualenv python environment (`poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true`)

## Different packages

This repository contains three packages with Google integrations with LangChain:
- [langchain-google-genai](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-google-genai/) implements integrations of Google [Generative AI](https://ai.google.dev/) models.
- [langchain-google-vertexai](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-google-vertexai/) implements integrations of Google Cloud [Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview)
- [langchain-google-community](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-google-community/) implements integrations for Google products that are not part of `langchain-google-vertexai` or `langchain-google-genai` packages

Each of these has its own development environment. Docs are run from the top-level makefile, but development
is split across separate test & release flows.

## Repository Structure

If you plan on contributing to LangChain-Google code or documentation, it can be useful
to understand the high level structure of the repository.

LangChain-Google is organized as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains multiple packages.

Here's the structure visualized as a tree:

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ community
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/unit_tests # Unit tests (present in each package not shown for brevity)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/integration_tests # Integration tests (present in each package not shown for brevity)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ genai
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vertexai
```

The root directory also contains the following files:

* `pyproject.toml`: Dependencies for building docs and linting docs, cookbook.
* `Makefile`: A file that contains shortcuts for building, linting and docs and cookbook.

There are other files in the root directory level, but their presence should be self-explanatory. Feel free to browse around!

## Local Development Dependencies

Install development requirements (for running langchain, running examples, linting, formatting, tests, and coverage):

```bash
poetry install --with lint,typing,test,test_integration
```

Then verify dependency installation:

```bash
make test
```

If during installation you receive a `WheelFileValidationError` for `debugpy`, please make sure you are running
Poetry v1.6.1+. This bug was present in older versions of Poetry (e.g. 1.4.1) and has been resolved in newer releases.
If you are still seeing this bug on v1.6.1+, you may also try disabling "modern installation"
(`poetry config installer.modern-installation false`) and re-installing requirements.
See [this `debugpy` issue](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy/issues/1246) for more details.

## Code Formatting

Formatting for this project is done via [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/).

To run formatting for a library, run the same command from the relevant library directory:

```bash
cd libs/{LIBRARY}
make format
```

Additionally, you can run the formatter only on the files that have been modified in your current branch as compared to the master branch using the format_diff command:

```bash
make format_diff
```

This is especially useful when you have made changes to a subset of the project and want to ensure your changes are properly formatted without affecting the rest of the codebase.

## Linting

Linting for this project is done via a combination of [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).

To run linting for docs, cookbook and templates:

```bash
make lint
```

To run linting for a library, run the same command from the relevant library directory:

```bash
cd libs/{LIBRARY}
make lint
```

In addition, you can run the linter only on the files that have been modified in your current branch as compared to the master branch using the lint_diff command:

```bash
make lint_diff
```

This can be very helpful when you've made changes to only certain parts of the project and want to ensure your changes meet the linting standards without having to check the entire codebase.

We recognize linting can be annoying - if you do not want to do it, please contact a project maintainer, and they can help you with it. We do not want this to be a blocker for good code getting contributed.

## Spellcheck

Spellchecking for this project is done via [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell).
Note that `codespell` finds common typos, so it could have false-positive (correctly spelled but rarely used) and false-negatives (not finding misspelled) words.

To check spelling for this project:

```bash
make spell_check
```

To fix spelling in place:

```bash
make spell_fix
```

If codespell is incorrectly flagging a word, you can skip spellcheck for that word by adding it to the codespell config in the `pyproject.toml` file.

```python
[tool.codespell]
...
# Add here:
ignore-words-list =...
```

## Working with Optional Dependencies

`community`, `genai`, and `vertexai` rely on optional dependencies to keep these packages lightweight.

You'll notice that `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` are **not** touched when you add optional dependencies below.

If you're adding a new dependency to Langchain-Google, assume that it will be an optional dependency, and
that most users won't have it installed.

Users who do not have the dependency installed should be able to **import** your code without
any side effects (no warnings, no errors, no exceptions).

To introduce the dependency to a library, please do the following:

1. Open extended_testing_deps.txt and add the dependency
2. Add a unit test that the very least attempts to import the new code. Ideally, the unit
test makes use of lightweight fixtures to test the logic of the code.
3. Please use the `@pytest.mark.requires(package_name)` decorator for any unit tests that require the dependency.

## Testing

All of our packages have unit tests and integration tests, and we favor unit tests over integration tests.

Unit tests run on every pull request, so they should be fast and reliable.

Integration tests run once a day, and they require more setup, so they should be reserved for confirming interface points with external services.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests cover modular logic that does not require calls to outside APIs.
If you add new logic, please add a unit test.
In unit tests we check pre/post processing and mocking all external dependencies.

To install dependencies for unit tests:

```bash
poetry install --with test
```

To run unit tests:

```bash
make test
```

To run unit tests in Docker:

```bash
make docker_tests
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
TEST_FILE=tests/unit_tests/test_imports.py make test
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests cover logic that requires making calls to outside APIs (often integration with other services).
If you add support for a new external API, please add a new integration test.

**Warning:** Almost no tests should be integration tests.

  Tests that require making network connections make it difficult for other
  developers to test the code.

  Instead favor relying on `responses` library and/or mock.patch to mock
  requests using small fixtures.

To install dependencies for integration tests:

```bash
poetry install --with test,test_integration
```

To run integration tests:

```bash
make integration_tests
```

#### Annotating integration tests

We annotate integration tests to separate those tests which heavily rely on GCP infrastructure. Especially for running those tests we have created a separate GCP project with all necessary infrastructure parts provisioned. To run the extended integration tests locally you will need to provision a GCP project and pass its configuration via env variables.

Test annotations:
1. Tests without annotations will be executed on every run of the integration tests pipeline.
2. Tests with release annotation ( @pytest.mark.release ) will be run with the release pipeline.
3. Tests with extended annotation ( @pytest.mark.extended ) will be run on each PR.

### Prepare

The integration tests use several search engines and databases. The tests
aim to verify the correct behavior of the engines and databases according to
their specifications and requirements.

To run some integration tests, you will need GCP project configured.
The configuration of the GCP project required for integration testing is stored in the [terraform folder]() within each library.

### Prepare environment variables for local testing:

- copy `tests/integration_tests/.env.example` to `tests/integration_tests/.env`
- set variables in `tests/integration_tests/.env` file, e.g `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Additionally, it's important to note that some integration tests may require certain
environment variables to be set, such as `PROJECT_ID`. Be sure to set any required
environment variables before running the tests to ensure they run correctly.

### Run some tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest tests/integration_tests/.py --cov=langchain --cov-report=html
start "" htmlcov/index.html || open htmlcov/index.html

```

### Coverage

Code coverage (i.e. the amount of code that is covered by unit tests) helps identify areas of the code that are potentially more or less brittle.

Coverage requires the dependencies for integration tests:

```bash
poetry install --with test_integration
```

To get a report of current coverage, run the following:

```bash
make coverage
```
